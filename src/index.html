Welcome. The Aurora is a non-profit collective of scholars, with a strong emphasis on hard science, without ever losing the tenderness of the humanities, nor losing our humanity itself.
At the Aurora and in its many spaces we strive to create an inclusive environment for people of all ages, genders, nationalities and educational backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
We are Scientists. We believe science is an essential tool for humanity to discover the world.
We are also humans, we believe artificial intelligence cannot replace natural self-awareness, empathy, and reflective critical thinking.
We believe people can become well-versed in cutting-edge science and technology at the same time that they understand the social and political context in which we are all inserted, and progress towards a better and more just world.
Wether they are a school-aged child who just started to develop a systematic understanding of knowldge, or a patents layer with twenty years experience in a very specific job, learning to think critically, understand science, coding, or mathematics should be both usful and exciting. -- check out what we have to offer in the form of courses, workshops, individual consulting, or collaborative research.
</p>

<p>
Overall, our vision is a knowledge ecosystem with low barriers for anyone who is intertested in learning about what is known as well as generating knowledge that does not yet exist. Our mission is to refound the place of knowledge as alternatives to the gatekept 'Ivory Tower' of Academia.
